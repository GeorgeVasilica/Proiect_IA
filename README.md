Bayesian Network GUI Project

This project is an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and analyzing Bayesian networks. It allows users to build a Bayesian network, assign probabilities to nodes, and visualize conditional probability tables (CPTs) for inference and decision-making.

    Features

  1. Interactive Canvas:

Create nodes (circles) representing variables in the Bayesian network.

Connect nodes with directed edges (arrows) to represent dependencies between variables.

Drag and reposition nodes for easy customization.
  
  2. Probability Assignment:

Double-click on a node to assign probabilities for True and False states.

Automatically update probabilities for child nodes based on dependencies.

  3. Dynamic Updates:

Supports relationships between nodes, including parent and grandparent dependencies.

Automatically adjusts calculations when network structure changes.
